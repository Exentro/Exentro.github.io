			Project I worked @ Fishing Cactus (between october 2018 to june 2019).
			<br>
			This is an barge boats simulator developped for navigability studies (inland navigation) in partnership with a specialized engineering company (DN&T).
			<br>
			The Unity part is built on top a DN&T DLL wich calculate the ship position and rotation according the inputs over time by the Unity layer. Being the only programmer assigned to that project I actually took care of almost all aspects of the programmation side of the project, such as (non exhaustive list) :
			<ul>
				<li>Architecture design and implementation</li>
				<li>Input Handling (commands) and DLL responses impact</li>
				<li>Third-parties plugins (Weather Maker Pro, Rewired, River Auto Material, ...)</li>
				<li>User graphical interfaces (GUI)</li>
			</ul>

			I don't have any ownership over the code so I can't share any piece of code or build.
